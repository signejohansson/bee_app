This is an Android app that uses the accelerometer and ambient light sensor of the phone. 
It contains two activities: one for showing accelerometer data and current light level, one for detecting shaking and then vibrating while playing a sound effect.
In the second activity you can also move an image of a bee around by tilting the phone.
