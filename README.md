## Bee App
This is an Android app that uses the accelerometer and ambient light sensor of the phone. 
It contains two activities: 
1. Showing accelerometer data and current light level
2. Detecting shaking, then vibrating while playing a sound effect.

In the second activity you can also move an image of a bee around by tilting the phone.

The accelerometer data and current light level is displayed on the sun and inside the cloud when you run the app.
